        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My project was inspired by my profession as a teacher. many a times we get overwhelmed by a need to balance our work and this has brought me to develop this application as a way of dealing with one of the challenges. as a student at Holberton School, i wanted to showcase my skills and create a portfolio projec that demonstrates my abilities in web development and user experience design</p>
        <p>Timeline: i started working on this project in October 2023 as part of my final portfolio project for Holberton School. it has been an ongoing effort to ensure the project meets the requirements and showcases technical skills</p>
        <p>This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School. you can learn more about Holberton School and its programs <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">here</a></p>
